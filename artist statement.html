      <h2>Artist statement</h2>
      <p>With my art I always talk about how I like to mix modern and vintage themes. I like to create that line with lots of overlay textures and vintage fonts but bringing new ideas and themes with my work. I like to bring in social issues like Black Lives Matter but also talking about black and queer excellence. I also love talking about women’s rights and reproductive rights. With bringing in these ideas I want to shed light on these issues and these ideas shouldn’t be a debate because we are who we are. This year is my first year at San Jose and it hasn't been an easier year due to the pandemic but I think getting through this year is enough for everyone. I think that my work isn’t as polished as i'd like it to be but I think that doing work to the best of your ability now in a national pandemic is good in my brain. I would love to be on campus but I also want to be safe and not worried if i could get sick. I love digital media art but my heart lies with Graphic Design. I have dreams of owning a studio and doing work for big companies. I love all sides of design but mostly want to make album covers and merch design. I hope that my work resonates with you and I strive for higher levels of knowledge with design.
